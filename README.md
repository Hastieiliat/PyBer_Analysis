# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
V. Isualize has given a brand-new assignment to the team. We need to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we need to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

# Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
In this section, we will sharing ride-sharing data among the different city types

As you can see in the picture, Urban city has the highest Fare between Jan to April. However, Rural has the lowest one. 

## describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

The sequence of the cities depends on ride-sharing is Urban with heighest numbers, second place is suburban and then rural with the lowest numbers.  

# Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
In all these pictures, Urban cities has the highes number of drivers, fare and also rides. Thus the type of city that CEO needs to focus on would be Urban cities.

## First Recommendation:
The CEO needs to focus on Urban cities since in all categories it has hiegher number
## Second Recommendation:
in month between Feb and March, there would be heighest number for Fare in all cities. Thus, this period would be the time that the CEO needs to focus on changing.
## Third Recommendation:
Rural cities in all categories has the lowest number. So for this phase of the project; CEO does not need to focus on this type of cities.
